# Google_Keep_Clone
In this project, we will explore how to create a Google Keep clone, a popular note-taking application, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By implementing key features such as adding notes, deleting notes, and archiving notes, we will develop a functional web application that mimics the core functionality of Google Keep.

## Functionality:

Adding Notes: Users will be able to create new notes by entering a title and content. Upon submission, the note will be dynamically added to the list of existing notes on the page.

Deleting Notes: Each note will have a delete button that, when clicked, will remove the corresponding note from the list of notes.

Archiving Notes: Users will have the option to archive notes they no longer need. The archived notes will be moved to a separate section, allowing users to declutter the main notes area.
