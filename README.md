# Google_Keep_Clone
In this project, we will explore how to create a Google Keep clone, a popular note-taking application, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By implementing key features such as adding notes, deleting notes, and archiving notes, we will develop a functional web application that mimics the core functionality of Google Keep.
